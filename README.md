# 🌿 Plant Care Finder – JavaScript Practice Project 🌞💧🐾  
A responsive and interactive plant information webpage built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (Fetch API)**. This project allows users to search for plants by their **common** or **scientific name**, and instantly view details such as **sunlight requirements**, **watering needs**, **pet-friendliness**, and an **image** — all fetched dynamically from a local JSON file.

### 👩‍💻 About the Project  
This project was created to explore **data fetching with the Fetch API** and working with **local JSON files** in JavaScript. I wanted to design a simple yet elegant way to present plant care information — something informative, fast, and visually calm.  
Building this helped me practice filtering logic, DOM updates, and custom interface design while keeping accessibility and clarity in focus.
